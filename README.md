# 🏡 Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine** for Airbnb listings using **Machine Learning**. The goal is to help hosts **maximize revenue and occupancy rates** by suggesting **optimal nightly prices** based on multiple features such as property details, seasonality, location, and demand trends.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To analyze Airbnb listing data and identify key factors influencing prices.  
- To build a predictive model that recommends dynamic nightly prices.  
- To provide a data-driven pricing strategy that adapts to market demand.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes features such as:  
- **Listing details** (room type, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities)  
- **Host information** (superhost status, response rate, reviews)  
- **Location data** (neighborhood, proximity to landmarks, city center)  
- **Demand-related factors** (seasonality, holidays, events, occupancy trends)  
- **Historical pricing and booking records**  

*(Dataset can be sourced from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) or Kaggle Airbnb datasets)*  

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values & outliers  
   - Encoding categorical features (One-Hot, Label Encoding)  
   - Feature scaling and normalization  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identifying pricing patterns across neighborhoods, seasons, and room types  
   - Correlation analysis between features and price  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Regression-based models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)  
   - Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)  
   - Ensemble techniques for improved accuracy  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - R² Score  

## 🚀 Results  
- The model can recommend competitive nightly prices for Airbnb hosts.  
- Achieved **high predictive accuracy** (update with your actual result).  
- Dynamic pricing improves host revenue while maintaining affordability for guests.
